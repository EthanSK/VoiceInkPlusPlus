**Trigger:** Ethan task 2026-06-16 (issues #785/#784)
**Symptom:** VoiceInk pastes into the right app but applies the WRONG Mode's auto-send key (issue #785); also nil-resolution left a stale Mode active (issue #784)
**Root cause:** Active Mode was resolved ONLY at record-start from NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication; Ethan starts recording then switches apps, so the Mode never followed the real target app. nil branch had no else, retaining the prior Mode.
**Fix:** Added NSWorkspace.didActivateApplicationNotification observer in ActiveWindowService.start() (wired from VoiceInk.swift app init) that re-runs the same app-config->default->neutral resolution on every frontmost change, including mid-recording (recorder is .nonactivatingPanel so it doesn't steal frontmost). Added else { setActiveConfiguration(nil) } for the neutral fallback. Refactored shared logic into resolveAndApplyConfiguration.
**Commit:** 570a6fa
**Guard:** Thorough comments at start()/handleFrontmostAppActivation/resolveAndApplyConfiguration; ignores own bundle id + nil bundle id; [weak self] in observer + async hop to avoid retain cycle / actor violation
