// MARK: - FocusLockService (Feature A: long-press → lock the start field)
//
// PROBLEM / WORKFLOW THIS SOLVES
// ------------------------------
// Default VoiceInk pastes the transcript into whatever app/field is frontmost at
// DELIVERY time (issue #785 "follow the frontmost app"). That's great for the
// common "start dictating, then click the target field" flow.
//
// But Ethan also wants the OPPOSITE flow sometimes: focus a specific text field,
// LONG-PRESS the record hotkey, then look away / click elsewhere while talking —
// and have the transcript land back in the ORIGINAL field he was in when he
// started, NOT wherever he happens to be at delivery.
//
// SOLUTION — "focus lock"
// -----------------------
// • A long-press (hold > threshold) of the record hotkey "locks" the system-wide
//   focused UI element captured at the START of the press as the delivery target.
// • While a lock is active we SUPPRESS the frontmost-app-follow (#785) for that
//   recording session — we deliberately want the start field, not the later one.
// • At delivery we re-activate the locked element's owning app and restore AX
//   focus to the stored element, THEN the normal paste + auto-send runs into it.
// • A normal/short press leaves no lock → fully default behavior (unchanged).
//
// ⚠️ PRIMARY MECHANISM IS NOW AUTOMATIC (2026-06-22) — the gesture is dead for Ethan.
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The manual long-press / stop-hold GESTURE above never works for Ethan: his record
// trigger is a MOUSE BUTTON that pulses ⇧⌃⌥ as a ~0.1s TAP — he can't hold it, so the
// stop-hold threshold never fires (see LEARNINGS commits 71e6dc9 / 6add5a0). So the
// decision is now made AUTOMATICALLY at paste time, with NO gesture required:
//   • We ALWAYS captureCandidate() at record-START (persisted for the session).
//   • At paste time we call isEditableElementFocused(): if an editable text element is
//     focused NOW → paste at the cursor (he moved to a real field). If NOTHING editable
//     is focused → autoPromoteAndRestoreToCandidate() restores focus to the START field
//     and pastes there.
// The old gesture plumbing (promoteToLock / stop-hold timer) is HARMLESS and left in
// place, but isEditableElementFocused() + autoPromoteAndRestoreToCandidate() are the new
// primary path. See those two methods below for the full classification + restore logic.
//
// LIFECYCLE (also see the inline comments at each method)
//   key-down            -> captureCandidate()  (remember focused element + app)
//   held past threshold -> promoteToLock()      (candidate becomes the active lock)
//   key released early  -> clearCandidate()     (short press: discard, default path)
//   delivery time       -> restoreFocusToLock() (re-activate app + set AX focus)
//   after delivery       -> clearLock()          (always, success or fail)
//
// ACCESSIBILITY DEPENDENCY
//   Capturing and restoring focus uses the Accessibility (AX) API. VoiceInk
//   ALREADY requires Accessibility to paste via simulated key events
//   (see CursorPaster), so this adds no new permission — if AX is denied, paste
//   wouldn't work anyway. Every AX call here degrades gracefully: if the system
//   doesn't return a focused element, or the stored element is gone/invalid at
//   delivery, we simply fall back to the default (frontmost) delivery path.
// NOTE: ObservableObject conformance (added for the recorder-UI indicator).
// The recorder views (MiniRecorderView / NotchRecorderView) show a small caption
// — "Using input from voice start" — ABOVE the waveform whenever a long-press
// focus lock is armed for the CURRENT recording. SwiftUI needs to observe that
// state to update live, so we publish `isLockActive` and bump it in the two
// places the lock transitions (promoteToLock arms it, clearLock releases it).
// @MainActor keeps all mutation on the main thread, which is also where SwiftUI
// reads @Published — so no actor hops / threading issues for the observers.

    // WHY THIS EXISTS — the modifier-only ~0.1s key-up problem:
    // Ethan's record shortcut is MODIFIER-ONLY (⇧⌃⌥, toggle mode). For a modifier-only
    // shortcut the OS reports the shortcut's "key-up" almost IMMEDIATELY (~0.1s) on the
    // STOP press, no matter how long he physically keeps the keys held down. (There is
    // no real keyDown/keyUp for a bare modifier combo — the monitor synthesises a
    // release as soon as the combo is recognised.) That spurious early key-up used to
    // take the "short-tap" branch and CANCEL the stop-hold threshold timer before it
    // could reach longPressThreshold (0.45s) — so the lock NEVER engaged, and every stop
    // logged as `STOP short-tap (dur≈0.10) → no lock`.
    //
    // THE FIX: for a modifier-only shortcut we IGNORE that flaky key-up entirely for the
    // lock decision and instead let the threshold timer fire, then ask the HARDWARE: are
    // the required modifier keys STILL physically held right now? `NSEvent.modifierFlags`
    // is a live global snapshot of the physical modifier state, independent of our
    // monitor's synthetic key-up. If the required modifiers are still down at the
    // threshold, it was a genuine long-hold → lock. If they've been released, it was a
    // real quick tap → no lock.
    //
    // `required` is the modifier mask of the active record shortcut (for Ethan: ⇧⌃⌥),
    // read from the Shortcut definition so we don't hardcode the combo. We compare with
    // `isSuperset` (not `==`) so the live flags only need to CONTAIN the required combo —
    // extra modifiers Ethan happens to be touching don't break the "still held" verdict.

    // MARK: - AUTOMATIC focus decision (2026-06-22): is an EDITABLE element focused NOW?
    //
    // WHY THIS EXISTS — the gesture is unusable for Ethan:
    // The original Feature-A design required a deliberate GESTURE (long-press / stop-hold
    // the record hotkey) to "engage" the focus lock so the transcript lands in the field
    // he started dictating in. That gesture NEVER works for Ethan because his record
    // trigger is a MOUSE BUTTON that pulses the ⇧⌃⌥ modifier combo as a ~0.1s TAP — he
    // physically cannot HOLD it. (See the modifier-only key-up notes above + LEARNINGS.md
    // commits 71e6dc9 / 6add5a0: every stop logged as a ~0.10–0.14s short-tap, so the
    // stop-hold threshold never fired and the lock never armed.)
    //
    // THE NEW PRIMARY MECHANISM — automatic, no gesture:
    // We still capture the focused field at record-START (captureCandidate, persisted for
    // the session). But instead of asking Ethan to perform a hold to "lock" it, at PASTE
    // time we look at whether an EDITABLE text element is currently focused:
    //   • Editable element focused now  → paste at the cursor (he moved to a real field —
    //                                       honor it, exactly like upstream).
    //   • Nothing editable focused now  → restore focus to the START candidate and paste
    //                                       THERE (focus dropped onto a button / non-text
    //                                       view / the desktop / a no-text app).
    // This function answers "is an editable element focused right now?" and is the heart
    // of that decision (called from TranscriptionDelivery.paste()).
    //
    // CLASSIFICATION + BIAS:
    // We read the frontmost app's AX focused element and inspect its role/subrole.
    //   • Clearly editable roles, or an element with a SETTABLE string kAXValue → true.
    //   • Ambiguous roles (web areas, groups, scroll areas, unknown, Electron/terminal
    //     generic contexts) → true. We BIAS HARD toward "true" because the ONLY thing the
    //     false branch does is hijack focus back to the start-field; we only want to do
    //     that when we are CONFIDENT nothing editable is focused. A false positive (saying
    //     "editable" when it wasn't) just pastes at the cursor — annoying but recoverable.
    //     A false negative (hijacking when an editable field WAS focused) would steal his
    //     paste out of the field he actually wants — much worse. So: when in doubt, true.
    //   • Clearly non-text roles (buttons, menu items, images, static text, checkboxes,
    //     radios, links, lists/rows/cells with no editable value, windows, the app itself)
    //     → false (these mean "no real text field has focus right now").
    //   • No focused element at all → false (focus dropped — exactly the restore case).
    //   • ANY AX call failing / returning nil → true (ambiguous, safe: don't hijack).
    //
    // VoiceInk++ SELF-EXCLUSION:
    // The recorder is a NON-ACTIVATING NSPanel, so it normally won't become frontmost.
    // But guard anyway: if our OWN app (com.ethansk.VoiceInkPlusPlus) is somehow frontmost
    // we must NOT treat our own panel's focus as "an editable field is focused" — that
    // would suppress the legitimate restore. In that case we fall back to the

        //
        // THE BUG: the default record mode is HYBRID, and the natural push-to-talk
        // gesture for an ordinary dictation is to HOLD the hotkey for the whole
        // utterance — which is almost always > longPressThreshold (450ms). That hold
        // PROMOTES a focus lock even though the user never moved to a DIFFERENT app.
        // At delivery we then ran the full restore dance (app.activate() +
        // AXUIElementSetAttributeValue of kAXFocusedUIElement to the element captured
        // 450ms+ earlier). By delivery that captured element is frequently STALE (the
        // field re-rendered, the app re-laid-out, the AX identity changed), so forcing
        // focus onto it — or simply re-activating + re-focusing immediately before the
        // Cmd+V CGEvent — created a focus race that swallowed the paste. Net effect for
        // a normal hold dictation: recorder shows "transcribing", waveform disappears,
        // and NOTHING is pasted.
        //
        // WHY THE OLD GUARD WASN'T ENOUGH: the 2026-06-17 guard only no-op'd when the
        // locked app was still frontmost AND the live focused element was CFEqual to
        // the element captured at key-down. But AXUIElement identity is NOT stable
        // across a record→click-into-a-field flow (the #785 case: start recording,
        // THEN click into the destination field in the SAME app). In that flow the
        // focused element at delivery is the CORRECT field but a DIFFERENT AXUIElement
        // ref than the one captured at key-down, so CFEqual fails → the code concluded
        // "focus moved" → ran activate() + AX-focus-set, re-focusing a STALE element
        // right before the Cmd+V → the paste was swallowed. The element-identity check
        // is the exact part that misfires.
        //
        // THE BROADENED GUARD: drop the CFEqual element-identity requirement. A lock
        // only NEEDS a restore when the user switched to a genuinely DIFFERENT app
        // (different frontmost pid). If the locked app is STILL frontmost — the
        // overwhelmingly common case, including the click-into-a-field-in-the-same-app
        // flow above — leave focus COMPLETELY alone and let the paste land in the live
