// MARK: - FocusLockService (Feature A: long-press → lock the start field)
//
// PROBLEM / WORKFLOW THIS SOLVES
// ------------------------------
// Default VoiceInk pastes the transcript into whatever app/field is frontmost at
// DELIVERY time (issue #785 "follow the frontmost app"). That's great for the
// common "start dictating, then click the target field" flow.
//
// But Ethan also wants the OPPOSITE flow sometimes: focus a specific text field,
// LONG-PRESS the record hotkey, then look away / click elsewhere while talking —
// and have the transcript land back in the ORIGINAL field he was in when he
// started, NOT wherever he happens to be at delivery.
//
// SOLUTION — "focus lock"
// -----------------------
// • A long-press (hold > threshold) of the record hotkey "locks" the system-wide
//   focused UI element captured at the START of the press as the delivery target.
// • While a lock is active we SUPPRESS the frontmost-app-follow (#785) for that
//   recording session — we deliberately want the start field, not the later one.
// • At delivery we re-activate the locked element's owning app and restore AX
//   focus to the stored element, THEN the normal paste + auto-send runs into it.
// • A normal/short press leaves no lock → fully default behavior (unchanged).
//
// LIFECYCLE (also see the inline comments at each method)
//   key-down            -> captureCandidate()  (remember focused element + app)
//   held past threshold -> promoteToLock()      (candidate becomes the active lock)
//   key released early  -> clearCandidate()     (short press: discard, default path)
//   delivery time       -> restoreFocusToLock() (re-activate app + set AX focus)
//   after delivery       -> clearLock()          (always, success or fail)
//
// ACCESSIBILITY DEPENDENCY
//   Capturing and restoring focus uses the Accessibility (AX) API. VoiceInk
//   ALREADY requires Accessibility to paste via simulated key events
//   (see CursorPaster), so this adds no new permission — if AX is denied, paste
//   wouldn't work anyway. Every AX call here degrades gracefully: if the system
//   doesn't return a focused element, or the stored element is gone/invalid at
//   delivery, we simply fall back to the default (frontmost) delivery path.
// NOTE: ObservableObject conformance (added for the recorder-UI indicator).
// The recorder views (MiniRecorderView / NotchRecorderView) show a small caption
// — "Using input from voice start" — ABOVE the waveform whenever a long-press
// focus lock is armed for the CURRENT recording. SwiftUI needs to observe that
// state to update live, so we publish `isLockActive` and bump it in the two
// places the lock transitions (promoteToLock arms it, clearLock releases it).
// @MainActor keeps all mutation on the main thread, which is also where SwiftUI
// reads @Published — so no actor hops / threading issues for the observers.

        //
        // THE BUG: the default record mode is HYBRID, and the natural push-to-talk
        // gesture for an ordinary dictation is to HOLD the hotkey for the whole
        // utterance — which is almost always > longPressThreshold (450ms). That hold
        // PROMOTES a focus lock even though the user never moved to a DIFFERENT app.
        // At delivery we then ran the full restore dance (app.activate() +
        // AXUIElementSetAttributeValue of kAXFocusedUIElement to the element captured
        // 450ms+ earlier). By delivery that captured element is frequently STALE (the
        // field re-rendered, the app re-laid-out, the AX identity changed), so forcing
        // focus onto it — or simply re-activating + re-focusing immediately before the
        // Cmd+V CGEvent — created a focus race that swallowed the paste. Net effect for
        // a normal hold dictation: recorder shows "transcribing", waveform disappears,
        // and NOTHING is pasted.
        //
        // WHY THE OLD GUARD WASN'T ENOUGH: the 2026-06-17 guard only no-op'd when the
        // locked app was still frontmost AND the live focused element was CFEqual to
        // the element captured at key-down. But AXUIElement identity is NOT stable
        // across a record→click-into-a-field flow (the #785 case: start recording,
        // THEN click into the destination field in the SAME app). In that flow the
        // focused element at delivery is the CORRECT field but a DIFFERENT AXUIElement
        // ref than the one captured at key-down, so CFEqual fails → the code concluded
        // "focus moved" → ran activate() + AX-focus-set, re-focusing a STALE element
        // right before the Cmd+V → the paste was swallowed. The element-identity check
        // is the exact part that misfires.
        //
        // THE BROADENED GUARD: drop the CFEqual element-identity requirement. A lock
        // only NEEDS a restore when the user switched to a genuinely DIFFERENT app
        // (different frontmost pid). If the locked app is STILL frontmost — the
        // overwhelmingly common case, including the click-into-a-field-in-the-same-app
        // flow above — leave focus COMPLETELY alone and let the paste land in the live
        // focused field, EXACTLY like upstream/base VoiceInk did before Feature A. The
